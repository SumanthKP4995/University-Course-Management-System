University Course Management System (Oracle SQL Project)


📌 Introduction  
The University Course Management System is a SQL-based project built on Oracle Database. It is designed to manage courses, students, instructors, and enrollments efficiently. This project demonstrates the use of SQL queries, relationships, and constraints to model a real-world university database system.


✨ Features  
- Manage students, courses, and instructors  
- Track student enrollments  
- Maintain grades and performance  
- Ensure data integrity using primary/foreign keys and constraints  
- Useful for academic institutions and database learners

  
🗄️ Database Schema  
The system contains the following main entities:  
- Students  
- Courses  
- Instructors  
- Enrollments  
- Departments


📊 ER Diagram  
The ER Diagram represents relationships between Students, Courses, Instructors, and Enrollments. It can be generated using tools such as dbdiagram.io or Draw.io.



⚙️ Installation & Setup  
1. Clone the repository:  
   git clone https://github.com/SumanthKP4995/University-Course-Management-System.git    
2. Navigate to the project folder and open the SQL files.  
3. Run the SQL scripts in Oracle SQL Developer or SQL*Plus.  
4. Verify that tables, constraints, and sample data are created successfully.



🚀 Usage  
- Run SELECT queries to retrieve student/course information.  
- Use INSERT queries to add new students, courses, or enrollments.  
- Use UPDATE queries to modify student grades.  
- Use DELETE queries carefully to remove records.



🔮 Future Enhancements  
- Implement triggers and stored procedures for automation.  
- Create views for easier data access.  
- Build a front-end interface connected to the Oracle database.
